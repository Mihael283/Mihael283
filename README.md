  <h1>
  Hi!
  </h1>
  <h2> My name is Mihael, and currently I'm working as an R&D Engineer at Protostar Labs, where we are utilising machine learning for solving problems in various industries. </h2>
  

I love exploring new technologies and challenges, but my expertise so far could be put in these two categories: machine learning and Python software development (full stack).
